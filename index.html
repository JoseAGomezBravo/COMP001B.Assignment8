        <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
        <p>What really helped me throughout the learning process was being able to look at past examples that showcased the proper ways to create code that I wanted to use on a new project.</p>

        <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>Something that I would change about this course, would be to encourage students to have some sort of folder that they could use as of diary to write down and come back later to look at the code.</p>

        <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
        <p>Yes, I learned everything that I expected from this class.</p>

        <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>Having taken a previous class, there were a lot concepts that I was familiar to already, such as color, font, and float.</p>
